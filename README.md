# Teleform.js

## Develop Locally. Deploy Globally. Debug Effortlessly.

**Teleform.js** is a Terraform-native tool designed to revolutionise the way you develop and debug AWS Lambda functions. By providing a transparent wrapper around the AWS Lambda resource in Terraform, Teleform.js enables you to run and debug Lambda functions directly on your local machine while interacting with live AWS infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Transparent Proxy**: Intercept Lambda invocation requests and route them to your local environment with a simple Terraform flag.
- **Local Debugging**: Code and debug Lambda functions locally, without the need for constant redeployment.
- **Ngrok Integration**: Securely connect your AWS environment to your local machine using ngrok for real-time, cloud-connected debugging.
- **Terraform-Native**: Works seamlessly within your existing Terraform workflow without additional complexity or setup.

## Installation

To get started with Teleform.js, you'll need to add the tool to your existing Terraform configuration.

```bash
npm install @uatec/teleform-cli
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Wrap Your Lambda in Teleform.js
Modify your existing Terraform AWS Lambda resource to use Teleform.js as a wrapper.

```hcl
module "my_function" {
  source       = "git::ssh://git@github.com/uatec/teleform.git//packages/terraform"
  name         = "my-lambda"
  handler      = "index.handler"
  runtime      = "nodejs20.x"
  role         = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec.arn
  environment {
    variables = {
      foo = "bar"
    }
  }
}
```
### Step 2: Deploy your code to was the normal way

The teleform terraform module will deploy your `aws_lambda_function` with no modifications, suitable for deployment in to production.

```sh
terraform apply
```

### Step 3: Start the Local Lambda Invocation Server
Once your lambda function is deployed, begin your development experience using terraform

```sh 
npx teleform-cli dev
```

This will re-deploy your terraform, but replace your lambda functions with a proxy which will route the request to your local machine.

### Step 4: Debug Locally
Now, any invocation of your Lambda function in AWS will be routed through to your local machine, allowing you to step through and debug your code in real time.

## How It Works
1. **Proxy Deployment**: Teleform.js deploys a proxy Lambda that intercepts invocation requests, forwarding them to your local machine via ngrok.
1. **Ngrok Tunnel**: Ngrok creates a secure tunnel between AWS and your local environment.
1. **Local Invocation**: The Lambda invocation is handled locally, where your function is 
executed from your file system for debugging.

## Roadmap

### Phase 0 - something that works
- [x] intercepter terraform
- [x] invocation forwarder
- [x] local server
- [x] total set up script
- [x] wire up env vars
- [x] wire up other parameters
- [x] resolve path to function from terraform aws_lambda_function parameters, not from the function name
- [x] git commit
- [x] ngrok client
- [x] CI/CD

### Phase 1 - Something that people can use

- [ ] client component discovery
- [ ] remove any hardcoded paths
- [ ] align module API with aws_lambda_function
- [ ] secure public endpoint
- [ ] clean up processes (local server)

### Phase ðŸ˜•

- [ ] teleform devex - cache-bust the debug_lambda?
- [ ] enter vpc
- [ ] local-server error handling
